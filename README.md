# 64klang
Official 64klang repository

Summary
-------

64klang is a modular, nodegraph based software synthesizer package intended to easily produce music for 64k intros (small executables with a maximum filesize of 65536 bytes containing realtime audio and visuals) or 32k executable music.

It consists of a VSTi plugin, a few example songs/instruments, as well as an example C project showing how to include it in your code for playback.

The repository contains the folders:
- VSTiPlugin (containing a .zip file with the precompiled VST plugin and example instruments/songs)
- Player (an example player project for using the exported files by the plugin)

The player project here is based on Visual Studio 2015, so that and above should compile out of the box.
